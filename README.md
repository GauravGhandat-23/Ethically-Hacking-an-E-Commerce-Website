# Ethically Hacking an E-Commerce Website

## Overview

This repository documents the exploration, analysis, and ethical hacking of a sandboxed e-commerce website intentionally designed with vulnerabilities. The project is a culmination of the Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking Internship Program, applying theoretical and practical knowledge to identify and exploit security flaws.

## Problem Statement

Web applications, especially e-commerce sites, are prime targets for cyber attackers due to their complex features and critical data handling. This project demonstrates the identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities in a controlled environment, simulating real-world ethical hacking scenarios.

## Objective

- Analyze the given sandboxed e-commerce application.
- Identify and document vulnerabilities.
- Explore their impacts and propose solutions to mitigate them.
- Preserve the integrity of the target system.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Nmap**: For network scanning and port enumeration.
- **Dirbuster**: For directory traversal and file discovery.
- **OWASP Juice Shop**: As the sandboxed vulnerable application.
- **SQLMap**: For exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.

| 9   | OSINT on Security Questions      | Reconnaissance Vulnerability| Credential compromise, targeted phishing attacks.                      |
| 10  | Login Injection                  | SQL Injection               | Database access, unauthorized actions, potential for mass exploitation.|

## Steps to Reproduce Key Vulnerabilities

### Example: DOM XSS
1. Navigate to the search bar on the application.
2. Inject the payload `<iframe src="javascript:alert('Juice Shop')">`.
3. Observe the execution of JavaScript code in the browser.
